<p>Title: FaceIt (Work in progress, subject to change)</p>
<p>Desription: A website used to share links, ideas, connect people, and facilitate growth driven conversation in an online enviroment. If you're familiar with Reddit and Facebook, a mashed together version of the two in sorts.</p>
<p>Vision Statement: "Facilitate conversation, share knowledge, and connect like minded people."</p>
<p>Motivation: Our motivation for this project is in part to learn how a website is created and its interaction with databases and content storage. We are also interested in taking a simple yet popular idea that was put forth by Reddit in having all content come from the user, while also connecting the users to one another is a more personal relationship, and finding ways to make it our own.</p>
<p>Risks: Many of us are new to the website creation, although we are all at least familiar with HTML and SQL.</p>
<p>Mitigation Strategy: Cam has built a website before and will be a valuable resource to us as we all work on our contributions. There are also countless online resources that we can and will use to familiarize ourselves with website creation.</p>
<p>User Stories: 001: As a submitter, I want an easy interface to use when submitting material so that it takes as little time as possible. 002: As a commenter, I want a simple, easy to follow comment chain interface so that I can follow the conversation. 003: As a lonely individual, I want a way to find people that share similar interests and get to know them individually. 004: As a knowledge seeking individual, I want an easy way to view lots of things that people find interesting to learn. 005: As a general user, I want an easy way to view specifically what I am looking for to make using the site streamlined. 006: As a submitter, I want simple to understand guidlines for submitting so that I don't go out of bounds. 006: As a Facebook user I like that I get to know my friends through their profile, but theres not much discussion between me and my friends beyond short comments. As a reddit user, theres great discussion, but I don't get to know the people I'm talking to. I want a social media that encourages the type of meaningful discussion seen on Reddit combined with the relationships and personality found on Facebook.</p>
<p>Methodology: Agile, though some of this will take place via texting as we talk about what we have finished.</p>
